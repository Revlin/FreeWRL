I've started running the NIST conformance tests.

Here are the results (I haven't tried nearly all yet):
Should FreeWRL fail one of the tests at some point, please inform me.

DISCLAIMER: THIS INFORMATION IS NOT NECESSARILY ACCURATE FOR ANY
GIVEN VERSION OF FREEWRL. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE/WARRANTY
THAT FREEWRL WILL PASS OR HAS PASSED ANY OF THESE TESTS.
