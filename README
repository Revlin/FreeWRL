Welcome to a developer-alpha release of VRML::Browser.

For updates, see the FreeWRL homepage, currently at 
http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~lukka/freewrl

DO NOT EXPECT YOUR COMPLICATED WORLD TO WORK!
If your world doesn't expect *much* more than the browser provides
right now, please send me a copy -- I'll make it work in the next
version. 

Textures are probably the last thing I'm going to make really well --
if you want to change that, buy me a computer with Linux-supported
3D acceleration for textures and you'll find them working in the next
release ;) ;) -- or just fix the implementation yourself.

See the file INSTALL for how to compile this program.

After installation, try

	./freewrl tests/1.wrl

(the file browse is the perl script which starts the browser -- if
there is a problem ("file not found"), try

	perl browse tests/1.wrl

or change the first line of "browse" to find your perl binary).

This should open a new window with a view of the VRML world in question.

Use the first and third button of your mouse (while moving your mouse)
to move around.

To change viewers between walk and examine, press 'w' or 'e' or 'd' in 
the browser window ('d' only works with the keyboard currently).

There are more tests in the bt/ and jt/ and pt/ directories, which
are, respectively, the browser API tests, java/javascript tests and
perl API tests.

E-mail any comments, questions & patches to me at lukka@fas.harvard.edu

	Tuomas J. Lukka

P.s. I am available for employment after july 1999 - email me if your
university or company is interested. I would like to be able 
at the same time to continue free software development and research.

-----------------
V0.08 - important details
 - using libwww-perl for getting documents from over the web.
   we can use general URLS, hurray!
   Because of this, perl scripts are now disabled by default
   because of security -- the code is completely trusted and
   we don't want you to get http://evil.foo/rm-rf.wrl containing
   a Perl script doing "system('rm -rf /'')".
 - use gunzip to decompress gzipped content
 - general ray code -- now IndexedFaceSet, ElevationGrid and even
   Extrusions should work with TouchSensors
 - "install" should now at least partially work. 
   Changed all "require 'foo.pm'" to "require VRML/foo.pm"
 - get_scene for the browser object -- now it is possible to
   create scenes in Perl scripts:
    "
    	use VRML::Browser;
	$b = new VRML::Browser;
	$s = $b->get_scene;
	$nod1 = $b->new_node(Shape, {
		geometry => $b->new_node(Box, { ... } ),
		...
	});
	...
	$s->topnodes([$nod1,$nod2,...]);
	$b->eventloop;
    "
   so you can use scripts to generate scenes.
 - then, use $scene->as_string to actually generate the VRML code
   in ASCII.
 - $backend->snapshot. See pt/* for samples
 - Documentation
 - Make the browser accept some faulty VRML (commas after field values)
 - Some portability fixes from John Breen and Lupe Christoph
 - fix IndexedFaceSet core dump if coordIndex doesn't end in -1
 - some event fixes. 

V0.07 - quick bug fixes
 - parse: make the optimization for MFFloat and MFTime correct when
   there are commas :(
 - fix FontStyle defaults
 - stabler quadratic solution from Robin Williams
 - background works again -- we can't displaylist something that moves ;)
 - better viewpoint implementation -- it still doesn't quite work
   like the spec. 

V0.06 - solidification:
 - input of SFColor etc. to javascript
 - output of floats etc. from javascript
 - numerous other bugfixes for javascript...
 - beginnings of the browser object in Perl
 - add OpenGL includes/defines for other makefiles as well..
 - Text should possibly be compatible with FreeType-1.1 now...
 - Fly mode, with key controls a la Descent(TM)!! Press 'D'
   when browsing and then use a,z and 789uiojklp; (the keys
   that are the numpad on my laptop ;) to move. If someone
   wants to send a patch to make the keys configurable, I'd be 
   delighted ( I don't want to spend time on that right now, I 
   have more important matters in this to do.. )
 - much faster MFFloat parsing -- similar speedups for other fields
   are just a matter of doing it..
 - various speed improvements
 - fixed use of display lists to actually work (blush)..

V0.05 - details...
 - Switch
 - LOD
 - face culling -> double speedup sometimes
 - DirectionalLight
 - PlaneSensor
 - SphereSensor
 - better support for bindable nodes
 - dummy Anchor ( == group )
 - add many missing fields (as dummies) to nodes

V0.04
Quick release, due to notification from Thomas Dudziak that
I had missed important files from the .tar.gz file. Oops...
 - Text!!!!!!! With FreeType library
 - Background basics (skyColor, skyAngle)
 - VRMLC -> VRMLC+VRMLRend - split to smaller files
 - Bindable nodes -- see nodes/Background2.wrl for what works now

V0.03 "filling in some blanks"
 - MFColor and other field types for javascript -- now able
   to run VRML97 spec example D.14!!


V0.02 "some things about *most* features work"
THIS RELEASE IS ESPECIALLY UNSTABLE - LOTS OF CODE HAS BEEN ADDED 
AND LOTS OF NEW FEATURES ARE SEMI-IMPLEMENTED. THERE ARE PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE
JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT SCRIPTS BUT MOST OF THOSE SCRIPTING INTERFACES
ARE STILL UNIMPLEMENTED. THE PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE SCRIPTS CAN BE FOUND
IN THE DIRECTORY jt/.

THE BROWSER IS STILL FAR FROM SPEC COMPLIANCE -- A LOT NEEDS TO BE DONE.
IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO PROGRAM, DO NOT EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS
BROWSER YET. THIS RELEASE IS PRIMARILY MADE TO ATTRACT POTENTIAL
DEVELOPERS TO HACK ON THE CODE.

 WHAT EXTRA IS SUPPOSED TO WORK NOW
  - simple scripting in complex languages (java,javascript)
    (warning: this is very immature so far - it's my first ever java
    program and I've only been at it for a couple of days. You have to
    make a named pipes in the current directory with the name '.javapipep'
    and '.javapipej', with the command "mknod .javapipep p" or the equivalent
    on your system).
    For javascript, you'll need to hack it to compile yourself - I'll
    try to provide a better make system later.
  - simple complex uses of simple sensor (touchsensor hitpoint,
    although only for primitives yet (no indexedfaceset :(...))
    This is by raycasting now, see VRMLC.pm
  - simple textures: jpg only, and only 2**n * 2**n.
    also, most texture mappings of nodes are not yet correct
  - Extrusion, ElevationGrid
  - Billboard
  - Browser: die if file not openable
  - Parser: accept ROUTE et al in more contexts 
  - CoordinateInterpolator
  - IndexedLineSet and PointSet
  - Shape with appearance==NULL
  - Color, Normal
  - more fields for supported nodes
  - Inline (preliminary)
  - beautify tests/ a little
 WHAT STILL DOES NOT WORK
  - more complicated things of any particular kind:
    - sensors
    - extrusions which are collinear
    - ...

SPECIFICALLY: FOR SCRIPTS IN JAVA/JAVASCRIPT:
 Eventin floats work and eventout colors work, not much else.
 Of course, this will be very easy to expand later (next version I hope
 to have MFthings and everything except Nodes.

 These scripting implementations are to be considered very preliminary and 
 just proof-of-principles.

 Especially the javascript interface is VERY UGLY. And contains
 unfinished code.

V0.01 "some things work"
 WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK
  - simple primitives (box, cone, cylinder, sphere, indexedfaceset*)
  - simple sensors (touchsensor, timesensor)
  - simple languages (perl)
  - simple nodes (scalarinterpolator,...)
  - simple structures (PROTO, USE/DEF)
 WHAT IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
  - complex geometries (elevationgrid, extrusion)
  - complex sensors (cylindersensor etc)
  - complex languages (java, javascript)
  - complex nodes (switch, lod...)
  - complex structures (anchor, externproto...)

(* indexedfaceset only partly implemented)
