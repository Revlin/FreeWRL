Stuff to do, easy ones first, more intricate ones later.

- Billboard: 0 0 0 is not correct ??

- Ignore .gif

- comment set_bind

- key mapping

- smooth normals

- normals as arguments

- smoother truetype: actually do bezier points..

- text justification 

- nonconvex polygons.

- proper reaction to sensor disabling while active

- Comment more

- elevationgrid triangulation: choose diagonal nicer.

- correct primitive texturing coordinates

- make Text generate polyrep instead of just rendering - then we can
  do button click / collision detection.

- key remapping.

- Transparency
- transparency (sourcebook ch10 fig10

- Anchor: make it do something..

- lights properly

- viewpoints with jump false

- SphereSensor: virtual sphere stays, may not move with coordinate
  motions -- ????? What does it mean e.g. when the user moves?

- as_string: ensure DEF/USE ordering correct-- how?

- JavaScript: rest of support. 
  Remember to do node.thing.thang correctly in the same way as 
  the parameters of the node itself -- but have to notice the events
  immediately. Hmmm...

- Collision, ground following, gravity

- EAI : see ARCHITECTURE for how to

- fix bindable nodes' loading so that the correct nodes get bound..
  nodes inside protos don't currently count.

- separate RFields into eventIns, eventOuts and fields

- multithreading: load & execute?

- SOFTREFS!!!
