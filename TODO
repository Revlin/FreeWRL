- separate RFields into eventIns, eventOuts and fields

- as_string: ensure DEF/USE ordering correct-- how?

- EAI : see ARCHITECTURE for how to


- fix bindable nodes' loading so that the correct nodes get bound..
- use timestamps for changes in nodes, for use with event routes
  and display lists
- multithreading: load & execute?
- binding nodes properly (was already done once but the event revamp
  undid it
- timesensor should ignore events when active.
- smooth normals
- fix bindable node loading: inside prototype instances!

- use one-sided polygons for primitives -> faster rendering

- smoother truetype: actually do bezier points..

- text justification 

- use libpng
- texture resizing

- proper reaction to sensor disabling while active

- PlaneSensor: limits.
- SphereSensor: virtual sphere stays, may not move with coordinate
  motions -- ????? What does it mean e.g. when the user moves?

- Anchor: make it do something..

- Billboard: 0 0 0 is not correct

- Extrusion, solid=TRUE...???

- SOFTREFS!!!

---------------------
- Specific features, by VRML sourcebook chapter/figure number 
--------------------
- ch4 fig9,10,11


- transparency (sourcebook ch10 fig10
- nonconvex polygons (sourcebook ch13 fig13 (fitting ;) )
- smooth normals (sourcebook ch13 fig15)
- smooth elevationgrid (ch14 fig2)
- elevationgrid triangulation: choose diagonal nicer.
- elevationgrid: is the sourcebook ch14fig3 wrong? I think x and z reversed
- extrusion : collinear
  - check extrusion: e.g. ch.15 fig17 produces completely different results. 
    I think they are wrong...
- correct primitive texturing coordinates
- normals (19);


- sunos5.6 config == earlier (in email)
