Stuff to do, easy ones first, more intricate ones later.

- install colormap optional!

- smooth normals

- smoother truetype: actually do bezier points..

- text justification 

- Billboard: 0 0 0 is not correct ??

- proper reaction to sensor disabling while active

- Extrusion, solid=TRUE...??? Straight spine cases

- use libpng

- texture resizing

- elevationgrid triangulation: choose diagonal nicer.

- correct primitive texturing coordinates

- viewpoint: transfer stuff to Viewer

- key remapping.

- Anchor: make it do something..

- lights properly

- viewpoints with jump false

- SphereSensor: virtual sphere stays, may not move with coordinate
  motions -- ????? What does it mean e.g. when the user moves?

- as_string: ensure DEF/USE ordering correct-- how?

- JavaScript: rest of support. 
  Remember to do node.thing.thang correctly in the same way as 
  the parameters of the node itself -- but have to notice the events
  immediately. Hmmm...

- Collision, ground following, gravity

- EAI : see ARCHITECTURE for how to

- fix bindable nodes' loading so that the correct nodes get bound..
  nodes inside protos don't currently count.

- separate RFields into eventIns, eventOuts and fields

- multithreading: load & execute?

- SOFTREFS!!!

---------------------
- Specific features, by VRML sourcebook chapter/figure number 
--------------------
- ch4 fig9,10,11


- transparency (sourcebook ch10 fig10
- nonconvex polygons (sourcebook ch13 fig13 (fitting ;) )
- smooth normals (sourcebook ch13 fig15)
- smooth elevationgrid (ch14 fig2)
- elevationgrid: is the sourcebook ch14fig3 wrong? I think x and z reversed
- extrusion : collinear
  - check extrusion: e.g. ch.15 fig17 produces completely different results. 
    I think they are wrong...
- normals (19);
