What code in the distribution is not mine (if I have left something
out, contact me as soon as possible at lukka@fas.harvard.edu - I really
want no-one to be left out accidentally) - I'm truly grateful to all
these people for their help:

 - Mozilla JS (http://www.mozilla.com) (JS/js)

 - John Breen's new WALK viewer (Viewer.pm, VRML::Viewer::Walk) + 
   Viewer handle RELEASE 

 - Robin Williams: numerical improvements to rendering - 2nd degree eqs
   + trigs

 - Bernhard Reiter: Extrusion genpolyrep code and nodes/Extrusion[23].wrl,
   misc comments & generated code cleanup (e.g. the cool vertical "standard"
   thingy ;)
