My own VRML97 spec interpretations -- please feel free to challenge.

1. PROTOs and ROUTEs and SCRIPTs.
 - SCRIPTs see the outer interface of the proto even when doing
   direct access, not the inside

2. TouchSensor
 - isOver events are not generated when the user doesn't move the mouse.
   if the user moves the mouse, the endpoint is compared with the current
   isOver status and if it's different, an event is generated.

3. Mouse sensors
 - spec is not explicit about events being generated only when 
   the geometry is at front - currently I only cast rays through
   sensitive nodes. 

   Probably I should change this at some point...

4. Sensors and the mouse button
 - after reading the spec and thinking about the intent, I think 
   that it is reasonable to freeze all other events except to where
   the mouse-press went.
